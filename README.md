Chord Estimation with Inversions in Beatles Songs


Previous approaches for automatic chord recognition focus on major and minor thirds, overlooking other significant features of the chords, such as chord inversions. A chord is inverted when a note other than the root appears in the bass, and inverted chords can alter a chord's perceptual function in a song. In this paper, we added bass information to major/minor chord estimates generated by an existing machine-learning-based method. This was accomplished by estimating the bass f0 track using the CREPE pitch tracker, and adding the bass line to the chord information.
In order to evaluate our method, we sampled 10 songs from the Beatles dataset and compared the estimated chord labels, combined with the bass information, to the reference annotation.
